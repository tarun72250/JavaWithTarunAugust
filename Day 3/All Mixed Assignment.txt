Operators Assignments:-
1.Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
2.Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a triangle having sides of length 2,3 and 5 units.
3.Write a program to add 8 to the number 2345 and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of the quotient is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result.
4.Now, solve the above question using assignment operators (eg. +=, -=, *=).
5.Write a program to check if the two numbers 23 and 45 are equal.
6.Write a program to print the power of 7 raised to 5.
7.Assign values of variables 'a' and 'b' as 55 and 70 respectively and then check if both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true.
8.Now solve the above question to check if atleast one of the conditions 'a < 50' or 'a < b' is true.
9.If the marks of Robert in three subjects are 78,45 and 62 respectively (each out of 100 ), write a program to calculate his total marks and percentage marks.
10.Suppose the values of variables 'a' and 'b' are 6 and 8 respecrtively, write two programs to swap the values of the two variables.
1 - first program by using a third variable
2 - second program without using any third variable
( Swapping means interchanging the values of the two variables E.g.- If entered value of x is 5 and y is 10 then after swapping the value of x and y should become 10 and 5 respectively.)
11.Write a program to convert Fahrenheit into Celsius.
12.The total number of students in a class are 90 out of which 45 are boys. If 50% of the total students secured grade 'A' out of which 20 are boys, then write a program to calculate the total number of girls getting grade 'A'.
13.Write a program to calculate the sum of the first and the second last digit of a 5 digit.
E.g.- NUMBER : 12345        OUTPUT : 1+4=5
14.Take a 4 digit number. Write a program to display a number whose digits are 2 greater than the corresponding digits of the number TAKEN.
For example, if the number which was taken is 5696, then the displayed number should be 7818.
15.Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a 3-digit number.
Number : 132        Output : 6
16.Write a program to reverse a 3-digit number. E.g.-Number : 132        Output : 231
